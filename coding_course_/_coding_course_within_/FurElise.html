        <h1 align = "center" font face = Times New Roman> Fur Elise </h1>
	
A love song which has imortalised dear Elise
<p>
Bagatelle No.25
</p>
<p>
Many rumours have swirlled regarding Beethoven but one this is for sure. Elise. She transcended all his accolades.
All his struggles and Elise is what remians. A woman moved him beyond his human limitations and has hence created Fur Elise.
A great work with which we are all familiar with and those of us who aren't, we have been given the opportunity to experience the song. 
Ambrosia for the ears. A story has been told without words but understood by everyone.
