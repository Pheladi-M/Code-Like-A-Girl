Througout history women have been undermined, overlooked and excluded. We had been robbed the opportunity to indulge the great great works of time. 
A sin to even think of participating in the writing of the grand historic scriptures. These words, pages, the ink, the messages that have gone beyond authors,
have stood against the test of time and stand before us here today are ours to experience. Literature in the form of books and poetry and art in the form of music are slowly dying without some of us women even knowing they existed.
This site serves to expose women to history,  to thought provoking, emotion evoking works that have moved even greatest mountains.

Explore the site and get lost in the culture.  Follow the links and read the opening themes of each piece. 
See the world through the eyes of the author, dare to go beyond and reiamgine their world in your own eyes.
Immerse yourself in a new world. Grow and evolve your thinking.
 Unlock the deep-rooted passion you never knew you had. 
Contribute and be more than your ancestors wildest dreams. 
The opportunity is here and I do hope you take it. Be inspired to create a great work of this era.
