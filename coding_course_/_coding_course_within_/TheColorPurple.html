		'Set in the deep American South between the wars, <i>The Color Purple</i> is the tale of Celie, a young black girl born into poverty and segregation.
		Raped repeatedly by the man she calls 'father', she has two children taken away from her, she is separated from her beloved sister Nettie and is trapped into an ugly marriage.
		But then she meets the glamorous Shug Avery - singer and magic-maker - a woman who has taken charge of her own destiny.
		Gradually Celie discovers the power and joy of her own spirit, freeing her from her past and reuniting with those she loves.</p>
		
		<p>
		<i> The Color Purple</i> is one of the all-time greats of literature, a global bestseller, and has inspired generations of readers.'
